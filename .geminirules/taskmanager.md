# Task Management Rules

1. **User Confirmation:** Before starting any unchecked ([ ]) task from Tasks.md, always ask the user for confirmation to begin work on that specific task. Write exactly what task you will start do. Take first on the list that is ready take do to. 
Example:
[x] this task is done
[ ] this task is to do
2. **Codebase Analysis:** After user approval, analyze the current codebase to determine if the task is already completed, partially implemented, or missing.
3. **Planning First:** If the task is not yet done, prepare a concrete, step-by-step plan to accomplish the task, referencing existing code where possible.
4. **Plan Confirmation:** Present the plan to the user and only proceed to implementation after receiving user confirmation.
5. **No Premature Coding:** Always operate in a planning/analysis mode first. Do not make code changes until the above steps are complete.
